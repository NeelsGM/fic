            <h3>1. Professional 3D Scanning</h3>
            <p>Don't spend hours measuring with calipers. We use advanced scanning to capture the "Point Cloud" of any physical object, creating a 0.03mm accurate digital twin.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>2. Reverse Engineering</h3>
            <p>Have a broken automotive clip or a discontinued part? We scan the remains and reconstruct a "clean" CAD model that is often stronger than the original.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-box">
            <h3>3. Print-Ready CAD Optimization</h3>
            <p>A beautiful model doesn't always print well. We design specifically for <strong>Additive Manufacturing</strong>, ensuring watertight meshes and optimal layer strength.</p>
